        <h3>DEEP PURPLE</h3>
        <p>The story of deep purple ....</p>
        <p>August 2018 I headed to the West Coast to visit my brother Michael who has lived in BC for many years now.  He took me to Vancouver Island and one of our first stops (after letting me stare into tide pools for hours and searching for chubby seals that evidently had moved on) was a huge park full of gardens.</p>

        <p>This is a little butterfly that lives in one of those gardens.  I suspect her name is Maureen, but itâ€™s hard to tell.  This trip overall was one of the highlights on my life and every photo from it is important to me. </p>
