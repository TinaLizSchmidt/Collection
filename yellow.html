        <p>The story of yellow ....</p>
        <p>This photo was taken on a gorgeous fall day as I was traipsing through the School of Horticulture in Niagara Falls.  There for a photography assignment, with friends I had forced to be my subjects, I was taken with these bright yellow bubble flowers.  What is there real name?  We may never know.  The important thing is that I did well on my photography assignment. </p>
